    # About **toronto.university**&trade; is a platform for higher education in Toronto. It is not a conventional tool, forum,
    or website. It is mobile-friendly, simple, and independent. It is an answer to continued politicization and commercialization
    of higher education. Not too long ago, universities were only for the elites. The institutions have opened up and evolved
    into the behemoths we see today. The higher education community needs a new way to better reflect and fulfill their needs.
    Universities in Toronto are falling short of expectation with outdated websites, poorly organized resources, and misinformation.
    It is unrealistic to expect the schools to address all the needs when they are run like businesses and worrying about
    political implications. As an open source and independent platform, toronto.university can - embrace the latest technology
    while official channels are reluctant to upgrade - put information about courses, map, and crimes front and center while
    official channels are busy with promotions and press coverages - approach matters with votes and statistics while official
    channels are muffled by controversy and sensitivity

    <img src="/assets/university_website.png" /> Together we can build a platform for everyone.
