    # Course Notes This is an experiment where everyone collaborates and collectively take notes for university classes. In other
    words, everyone becomes a "note taking volunteer" and learn from it. Each course has a unique google doc. If your course
    is not in the list, you can create a new google doc and paste the link in the Notes Glossary. Please use all these notes
    with the best intention. You can report abuse to
